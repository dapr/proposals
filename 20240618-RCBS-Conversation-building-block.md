# Conversation building block

## Overview

This is a proposal for a new building block for Dapr to allow developers to leverage LLM services in a consistent way. Goal is to expose an API that allows developers to ask Dapr to do request.

## Background

Now there are many large language model servers or toolkits, which provides own APIs, like [OpenAI](https://openai.com/), [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/), [Kserve](https://kserve.github.io/website/latest/), [OpenVINO](https://docs.openvino.ai/) and so on.

For developers, it is hard to migrate from one to the other due to hardcode and API differences.

For startups and communities, they need to implement the popular APIs as soon as possible, or users maybe give up tring or adopting because of the cost of migration.

This is an area where Dapr can help. We can offer an abstraction layer on those APIs.

## gRPC APIs

In the Dapr gRPC APIs, we are extending the `runtime.v1.Dapr` service to add new methods:

> Note: APIs will have "Alpha1" added while in preview

> Note: The API token is stored in context

```proto
// (Existing Dapr service)
service Dapr {
  // Conversate.
  rpc Converse(stream ConversationRequest) returns (stream ConversationResponse);
}

// ConversationRequest is the request object for Conversation.
message ConversationRequest {
  // Inputs for the conversation, support multiple input in one time.
  repeated string inputs = 1;
  // Parameters for all custom fields.
  repeated google.protobuf.Any parameters = 2;

  // The metadata passing to conversation components

  enum LoadBalancingPolicy {
    // Round robin policy.
    ROUNDROBIN = 0;
  }

  // Endpoints for the model service, co-work with load balanace policy.
  repeated string endpoints = 3;
  // Name of the model.
  string model = 4;
  // Key of API token
  string key = 5;
  // Load balancing policy for endpoints.
  LoadBalancingPolicy policy = 6;
}

// ConversationResult is the result for one input.
message ConversationResult {
  // Result for the one conversation input.
  string result = 1;
  // Parameters for all custom fields.
  repeated google.protobuf.Any parameters = 2;
}

// ConversationResponse is the response for Conversation.
message ConversationResponse {
  // An array of results.
  repeated ConversationResult outputs = 1;
}
```

## HTTP APIs

The HTTP APIs are same with the gRPC APIsï¼š

`POST /v1.0/conversation/[component]/converse` -> Conversate

```json
REQUEST = {
  "metadata": {
    "model": "gpt-4o",
    "endpoint": "api.openai.com",
    "key": "token-key"
  },
  "inputs": ["what is Dapr"],
  "parameters": {},
  "policy": 0,
}

RESPONSE  = {
  "id": "123",
  "outputs": {
    "result": "Dapr is ...",
    "parameters": {},
  },
}
```

> Note: URL will begin with `/v1.0-alpha1` while in preview
